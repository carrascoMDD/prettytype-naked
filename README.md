# prettytype-naked

Module, prototype and inheritance patterns, deconstructed into elemental mechanisms, and constructed step-wise into the whole, to better grasp how to come out with prettytype github project and npm package.

Explains patterns used in npm package prettytype:  https://github.com/carrascoMDD/prettytype 

Multi-platform Javascript EC5 coding patterns and base super-prototypes, for write-once, run and test everywhere (angularjs, requirejs, nodejs).

Reused i.e. in the SpringNut.org example. http://www.springnut.org/springnut , government projects like the administration and instrumentation UI, and the end-2-end testing of the Official REgistry of Causes of Death of the Valencia regional government. Reused also in the offline extension of iGEO ERP environmental health app.
